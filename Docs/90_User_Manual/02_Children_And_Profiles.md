# Children and Profiles

## Children list/cards (implemented)
- The **Children** page displays child cards.
- Each card links to the child’s profile.

## Add Child modal flow (implemented)
- Use **Add Child** to create a profile.
- Avatar selection includes **crop tools**.

## Child profile tabs (implemented)
The child profile exposes multiple tabs for configuration and review (exact tab names may evolve with policy coverage).

### Expected behavior
- No UI regressions: cards, modal flow, avatar crop, and tabs must remain functional.
