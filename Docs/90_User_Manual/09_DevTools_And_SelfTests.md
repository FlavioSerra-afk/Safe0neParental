# DevTools and Self-Tests

## Hidden DevTools unlock (implemented)
DevTools are intentionally hidden in normal use.

- Use the **hidden unlock gesture** (7x tap) to reveal DevTools.
- Toggle DevTools off to hide again; the gesture should re-enable.

## Self-test badge and marker tests
- The router/self-test badge indicates health of critical UI pipelines.
- Marker/guard tests must remain green (additive only).
