# Alerts and Inbox

## Alerts inbox (implemented)
- Alerts are routed using persisted routing configuration.
- Inbox supports grouping and filters.
- Alerts can be acknowledged (ACK) using SSOT-backed endpoints.

## Notes
- If the Alerts self-test is failing due to a script parse error, treat it as a **blocking regression** and fix immediately.
